An open source compact rotary tool that fits in your pocket. 

# Intro

This is an open source rotary tool that I am developing and will be making once the design is finalized. Any help to this project would be greatly appreciated. 

# Specs

- It has a 7.4V 14650 battery that runs an RS-380 motor.
- Motor is capable of running at 25000rpm (no load). Rated current is 4A, so it would draw approx. 20-30W. 
- The housing is to be 3D printed with a heat-resistant material.
- It charges via USB-C using a 9V trigger. You would need a power delivery certified USB-C power supply that is capable of switching to 9V. I figure this is better than using a barrel jack.
- target exterior size: around 93x50x35mm not including the rotary shaft that will stick out a little bit.
- PCBs being designed in KiCad.
- Will include safety measures such as stall detection and a thermistor for monitoring temperature.
- A physical safety cover will be implemented over the throttle slider so that it is impossible to accidentally turn on while in your pocket.
